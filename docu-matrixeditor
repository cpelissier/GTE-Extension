Behavior w.r.t. keyboard input

Player 1:
Number of strategies [numstrats1]
Strategy names       [names1]
Payoffs              [payoffs1]

Player 2:
Number of strategies [numstrats2]  <disabled for symmetric games>
Strategy names       [names2]
Payoffs              [payoffs2]    <disabled for zero-sum and symmetric ames>

[numstrats1] and [numstrats2]
permitted entries: integer 1 to 26 (later to be expanded)
default values: 3 for both (can be changed)

reaction after <ENTER> key: 
- updates the rows/columns of the two payoff matrices:
  - If FEWER rows than before: truncate the DISPLAY of what
    was shown before, but do NOT change or reset the
    additional rows 
  - If MORE rows than before: expand the display with what
    was in the matrix before (0 at initialization).
- updates the strategy names:
  truncates/expands the displayed list of strategy names
- skip to next tab entry

[names1] and [names2]:
default values:  A-Z and a-z
reaction after <ENTER> key:
- skip to next tab entry

default values reset with <RESET> button

[payoffs1] and [payoffs2]:
reaction after <ENTER> key:
- newline in text entry but do not leave input area

clicking on the bottom [confirm payoffs] button:
- read all input fields
- react as if [numstrats1] and [numstrats2] have been
  clicked, i.e. adjust strategy names list and row and
  columns
- convert to fraction or decimal according to current
  setting
- adjusting column widths

clicking the [zerosum] or [symmetric game] button:
- grey out [payoffs2] (non-editable), but do not
  change entries until "confirm payoffs" or change of
  rows/columns with <ENTER> key
  (reason: this leaves the payoffs untouched if those
  buttons are clicked accidentally)
clicking the [symmetric game] button:
- grey out [numstrats2]
